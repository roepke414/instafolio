description: I was tasked with milling two parts for a friend who needed adaptors for a conversion from a plasma cutter to a CNC router.
The part was milled out of 60601-T6 Aluminum and needed four threaded holes with countersinks. I used a variety of milling tools and center finders to properly allign everything within spec of the drawing.
Tolerances were ran at about +-.001"
