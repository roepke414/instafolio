  Since I purchased my Subaru I would take it to car shows and was always excited to be apart of the Subaru community, but while I was at these shows I would see how much shinier and glossier other peoples cars would look compared to mine, this was the start of my journey into the world of automotive detailing. I self taught myself through youtube videos, forum posts, and detailing websites how to write ups. My goal was to get my car to look as good as possible, just like the show cars at conventions. I ended up detailing my own car in the late summer of 2018 and below is the results of my endeavors as well as some of my favorite cars I have done for friends and clients.
  
  My products and tools: Griots Garage DA, Lake Country CSS Pads (orange, black, white), Meguiars Caranuba Wax, Blackfire Compound and Polish, Meguiars Gold Class Wash, Chemical Guys Jet Seal, Chemical Guys Blacklight Glossifier, Blackfire Spray Detail Wax.
  
    
  Here is what my cars paint looked like after I washed it, stripped it of any wax and contaminants, as well as a throurough clay bar. Note the dullness of the paint as well as all the cross scratches and micro swirls in the paint:

  Here is the comparison between the original paint and the first pass of compound:

  Here is the final product of what the car looked like after compound, polishing the paint, applying sealant, and then a glossifier wax:
