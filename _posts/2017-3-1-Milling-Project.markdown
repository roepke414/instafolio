description: I was tasked with creating a part out of a block of aluminum to a +-.001 spec for a friend of mine. It was a modified clamping block for converting a CNC plasma cutter to a CNC router. The block was made from 6061 T6 aluminum and required threded holes and countersunk holes for the piece to be flush all around.
