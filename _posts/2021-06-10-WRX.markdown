  I purchased a used 2012 Subaru WRX in November 2018 with the intentions of using it as a reliable daily driver as well as a fun weekend track car and cruiser. The vehicle required some general modification to increase the perfomance of it on the track to be competetive with other drivers of the same class. Modifications are as follows, Invidia High Flow Catted Downpiper, Invidia N1 Exhaust, GrimmSpeed EBCS, COBB CAI, COBB Access Port V3, JM Automotive Tune on 91oc by Devin, Short Throw Shifter, Upgraded Rear Sway Bar 20mm, Upgraded Suspension Bushings, Agressive Alignment Front/Rear Camber 1.6DEG/1.4DEG Zero Toe, Secondary Air System Delete, Upgraded Clutch and Pressure Plate. 
  
    
  The finished results turned out the be a perfect fun track car for the weekends, and a still comfortable and tolerable vehicle to take to work:
