description: The purpose of this ongoing project was to begin learning about the abilities of a FFF 3D Printer. I use the Mono Price Maker Select V2 currently with an upgraded all aluminum carriage, Y-bracing, glass build plate, a upgraded cooling fan for the nozzle, and a x-axis belt tensioner. I have been working with various people to help them develop prototypes for their various projects ranging from the medical field to patenting specialized storage containers as pictured above. The next steps with the printer are to be able to develop useful parts for a automotive application, specifically a 2012 Subaru WRX. The use of ABS plastics and PETG to aid in structural durability and heat resistance will aid in the production of strong parts.
