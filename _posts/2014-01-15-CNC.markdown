description: The goal of this project was to creat a profile of a image in PTC Creo and then write the G&N code for it to be CNC machined. The image was constrained to a 5inch by 5inch by 1inch block of plastic and was required to have four holes drilled in each corner along with the image being encompassed by a circle. Once the G-Code was written it was ran through a test program to check for errors and tool path faults. Then the CNC machine was set up, zeroed, and ran by the student. Results were not as expected, tooling that was provided was incorrect, leveling bars were not level, and feed speeds and spindle RPM were not changable.
