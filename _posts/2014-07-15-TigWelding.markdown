description: I took it upon myself to begin to learn how to weld with a TIG welder. The project began with welding mild steel bars to one another and grasping the concept of how to hold the tungsten and filler rod. Next was learning how to lay down a bead of weld and push it along the line that needed to be welded. After that was accomplished it was a matter of constant practice to be able to lay a good bead and not push too much heat into the material. The next goal of this project is to begin to learn how to weld coped tubes and angled pieces.
