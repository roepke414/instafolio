description: I purchased a used 1995 Honda CB500 Interceptor that had trouble idling and starting.
  The first steps I took were to de-rust the gas tank and fuel lines, to do this I emptied out all of the gas from the tank and the system. Next I took small plastic beads and some distilled water and vinegar and place them in the tank and shook the tank as much as I could, each time emptying the mixture and beads and repeating.
  Next I washed out all the fuel lines and replaced the dated fuel filter along with new fuel hose from the tank to the filter to the carbs. Once this was complete I was told that the carb boots were torn and not sealing well so I purchased new boots and installed them before re-installing the gas tank and fuel lines.
  Next I had a friend help me with starting the bike, we hooked up the bikes battery which was new to a trickle charger and began to crank the bike over listening for air leaks and looking for fuel leaks. We notices one of the seals on the carb bowls was leaking and disassembled the bike again to get the carb bowls off. Upon further inspection the carb bowls had multiple torn gaskets and needed replacement.
  Also upon inspection we noticed that there were clogged jets, I had to use a combination of WD40 and PB Blaster and a pair of vice grips to remove the jets, they were very stuck. I ordered new jets and got them installed as soon as my order of carb bowl gaskets arrived.
  Then we re-installed all of the parts and filled the bike with fresh gas and put in new spark plugs. We attempted to start the bike a few times without success, I adjusted the main idle screw a few times untill we got the bike to sound like it was trying to start. I finally found the right balance with idle and throttle to get the bike to start. After experimenting with the idle screw and getting the bike warmed up with a fresh oil change of course, the bike began to start on its own without throttle.
  It was cold out around 40*F, and I took the bike for a test drive, all it needed after that was new tires and it was ready to ride.
  After all the work I sold the bike since I had no need for it being in college.
