The start of my detailing side career began when I noticed cars at car shows had just immaculate and beautiful paint that shined and poped, when I would look at my car it did not have the same effect. So I decided to enter the world of detailing. I started detailing cars in late 2018 and continue to do it to this day for friends and some customers.

Over time I have detailed many different cars but below is some of my best work and some of the favorite cars I have had the opportunity to work on.

My equipment, Griots Garage DA, Blackfire Polish and Compound, Lake Country CSS Pads (orange, black, white grits), Chemical Guys Jet Seal, Chemical Guys Blacklight Finish, Meguiars Caranuba Wax, Meguiars Hybrid Ceramic Spray Wax.
