  I was tasked with creating a part out of a block of aluminum to a +-.001 spec for a friend of mine. It was a modified clamping block for converting a CNC plasma cutter to a CNC router. The block was made from 6061 T6 aluminum and required threded holes and countersunk holes for the piece to be flush all around.
  
    
  Here is the finished piece with the bolts:
